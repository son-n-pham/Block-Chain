# Blockchain defined: Bitcoin & Blockchain

## Bitcoin:
### The ledger
#### Linked timestamping
#### Merkle trees
#### Byzantines fault tolerance
- Linked timestamping is not enough to resolve forks, which means some notes think block A is the latest while others think it is block B.
- Nakamoto asserts that the Proof-of-Work chain solves this problem
#### Proof of Work
#### Putting all together - Incentive - Miner and mining
- Miners are constantly in a race with each other to find the next Proof-of-Work block
- Miner who solves the Proof-of-Work gets incentive.
- Because of monetary incentives, miners ensure each other's compliance with the protocol
- The transaction contains only public key of the participating parties.
  - Transaction transfer value from and to public keys, which are called address.
