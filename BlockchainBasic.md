# Blockchain defined: Bitcoin & Blockchain

## Bitcoin:
### The ledger
#### Linked timestamping
#### Merkle trees
#### Byzantines fault tolerance
- Linked timestamping is not enough to resolve forks, which means some notes think block A is the latest while others think it is block B.
- Nakamoto asserts that the Proof-of-Work chain solves this problem
#### Proof of Work
- Issue of PoW:
  - Using lots of electricity
  - Can only process a limited number of transactions simultaneously
#### Putting all together - Incentive - Miner and mining
- Miners are constantly in a race with each other to find the next Proof-of-Work block
- Miner who solves the Proof-of-Work gets incentive.
- Because of monetary incentives, miners ensure each other's compliance with the protocol
- The transaction contains only public key of the participating parties.
  - Transaction transfer value from and to public keys, which are called address.

#### Bitcoin vs Etherum Blockchains:

- Similarity
  - They both are public, decentralized peer-to-peer networks with their own tolken.
  - Both rely on crtoraphy
  - Both use digital ledger technology
- Difference
   | Bitcoin | Ethereum
   | -- | --
  Purpose | Bitcoin is a decentralized payment system and a sotre of value. Bit coint is a database of all bitcoin transactions and tracks their ownership | Etherum is more than a payment system and allows smart contract and Dapps to be built on it
  
## 3 fundamental characteristics defining a blockchain
- Block chain is bitcoin's main invention.
- 2 fundamental blockchain properties:
  - Immutable records: Immutable ledger means we can trust it to be accurate
  - Distributed: protects the blockchain from network attacks.

## Algorithms and techniques enabling a blockchain
## Methods for realizing trust in a blockchain
