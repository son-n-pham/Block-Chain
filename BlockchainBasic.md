# Module 1: Blockchain defined: Bitcoin & Blockchain

## Bitcoin:
### The ledger
#### Linked timestamping
#### Merkle trees
### Byzantines fault tolerance
- Linked timestamping is not enough to resolve forks, which means some notes think block A is the latest while others think it is block B.
- Nakamoto asserts that the Proof-of-Work chain solves this problem
### Proof of Work
- Issue of PoW:
  - Using lots of electricity
  - Can only process a limited number of transactions simultaneously
### Putting all together - Incentive - Miner and mining
- Miners are constantly in a race with each other to find the next Proof-of-Work block
- Miner who solves the Proof-of-Work gets incentive.
- Because of monetary incentives, miners ensure each other's compliance with the protocol
- The transaction contains only public key of the participating parties.
  - Transaction transfer value from and to public keys, which are called address.

### Bitcoin vs Etherum Blockchains:

- Similarity
  - They both are public, decentralized peer-to-peer networks with their own tolken.
  - Both rely on crtoraphy
  - Both use digital ledger technology
- Difference
  Bitcoin | Ethereum
  -- | --
  Bitcoin is a decentralized payment system and a sotre of value. Bit coint is a database of all bitcoin transactions and tracks their ownership | Etherum is more than a payment system and allows smart contract and Dapps to be built on it
  
## 3 fundamental characteristics defining a blockchain

- Block chain is bitcoin's main invention.

- 2 fundamental blockchain properties:
  - Immutable records: Immutable ledger means we can trust it to be accurate
  - Distributed: protects the blockchain from network attacks.

- 2 primary components:
  - A decentralized network facilitating and verifying transactions
  - The immutable ledger that network maintains

- It is to answer: How can we conllectively trust what happens onlin?

# Blockchain Structures

- Transactions form a block
- Blocks chain to each other
- Block goes through Concensus & Verify
- Concensus & verify are done by miner

## Single transaction in Bitcoin

Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO):
- Unique identifier of the transaction creating the UTXO
- Index of this UTXO in the transaction's output list
- Value
- Optional: Conditions under which output can be spent

Transaction (Tx):
- Reference number of the the current transactions
- Reference(s) to one or more input UTXOs
- Reference(s) to one or more output UTXOs newly generated by the current transaction
- Total input and output amount

Block:
- A block in Blockchain has a header and transactions

## Basic Operations

Basic options
- Validation of transactions
- Gathering transactions for a block
- Broadcasting valid transactions & blocks
- Consensus on next block creation
- Chaining blocks

Participants:
- Participants initiate transaction
- Miner:
  - Works: Verify transaction, broadcast transactions, compete to create a block, reach consensus by validating block, broadcast new block, confirm transactions
  - Miners get incentive when the above work is completed.

## Beyond Bitcoin

### Smart Contract

### 3 types of blockchains:
#### Type 1: Only Cryptocurrency, ie. Bitcoin
#### Type 2: Currency and business logic, ie. Ethereum
#### Type 3: Only business logic, ie. Linux Hyperledger

### Blockchain Categories based on Access Limit:
#### Public
#### Private
#### Permission (Consortium)
